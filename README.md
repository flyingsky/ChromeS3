Amazon S3 extension for Chrome

S3Fox is a great extenstion for Amazon S3 on Firefox, but I cannot find a similar one on Chrome. I think we should have one. So just do it and make it even better.

I want to make it opensource, so you can add your customized features if you like, such as add count objects in bucket.
